# Verification

This file defines universal verification strategy. The actual project defines its real commands, toolchain, tests, build system, formatters, generated artifacts, and verification checks.

## Core rule

Terminal repository verification is the final technical verification step for a finished candidate. It is not the implementation feedback loop.

## Implementation feedback loop

Use the smallest meaningful check that can prove or falsify the current implementation hypothesis.

Typical progression:

1. exact reproducer, focused test, or narrow check;
2. affected component, package, or module;
3. affected subsystem when the narrower layer is green;
4. broader repository checks only when evidence requires them;
5. terminal repository verification on the finished candidate.

Do not repeatedly run the entire repository suite or remote CI while diagnosing a narrow failure if a smaller reproducer can provide faster, clearer evidence.

## Terminal repository verification

Run complete project-defined repository verification only on a finished candidate.

Terminal repository verification must validate the candidate that is actually proposed for review. Any source or generated-state change after verification invalidates the previous terminal result and creates a new candidate.

CI or verification must not silently mutate the candidate being verified.

## Terminal verification failure

If terminal repository verification fails:

1. identify the smallest useful reproducer for the failure;
2. leave the terminal-verification loop;
3. diagnose and fix narrowly;
4. regain targeted green evidence;
5. produce a new finished candidate;
6. run terminal repository verification again.

## Distinct operation classes

Do not collapse unrelated work into a generic “run CI” action. Distinguish as needed:

- source/behavior feedback;
- compiler/build checks;
- format/lint checks;
- dependency-state generation;
- generated contracts or schemas;
- environment/toolchain execution availability;
- repository/provider administration;
- security-specific verification;
- terminal repository verification.

Dependency state should change only when the dependency graph actually changes.

Generated contracts follow the system that generates them; they are not automatically dependency state.

Formatting verification reports formatting state. It does not imply permission to mutate, commit, or push unrelated changes.

## Evidence

Verification evidence should state what was run, what candidate it applied to, and the relevant result.

Unresolved or unavailable verification must be reported explicitly rather than inferred as passing.
